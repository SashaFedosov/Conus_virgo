# Conus_virgo
This repository contains supplementary data, and tables of the manuscript on Conus virgo transcriptomics, as well, as the original scripts used for the analysis and parsing of the data.
Directory content:

Suplementary tables 1-4. - The MS EXcel file, containing the four spreadsheets with the supp. tables.

Supplementary data1. – Zip Archive. FastQC reports of the quality of the original Conus virgo Illumina Sequencing files.
Supplementary data2. – Zip Archive. Trinity assemblies of Conus virgo, C. geographus, and C. rolani. These exceed the GitHub per-file quota, and can be downloaded from the personal clowd storage of A. Fedosov here: https://mega.nz/file/M4YQ0aiY#PMN_7w3dlT0oBdFo040EZhk8MVv1X2ap96V5lWjKftk
Supplementary data3. – Zip Archive. In-house toxin database, and BLASTx output files constituting the basis of reference based transcript annotation of Conus virgo, C. geographus, and C. rolani. 
Supplementary data4. – Zip Archive. HMMER annotation and BLASTp against the Uniprot database annotation of the predicted secreted transcripts of Conus virgo.
Supplementary data5. - Zip Archive. Scripts used run analyses, and parse data files.
